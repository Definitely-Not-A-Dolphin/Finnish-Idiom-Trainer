This program was made by me (Derek). 
For no particular reason, I learning the Finnish language, which is quite a challange.

About me:
I am a boy from The Netherlands with not too much programming experience. 
I am more of a math guy, but have recently been doing a lot of programming.
I only know two programming languages: Python and C++. 
I originally decided to learn C++ for better accuraccy for programs that could calculate pi and e, which really worked.
HTML will soon join that list, since because a friend gave me a webdomain for 2 years, https://geen-dolfijn.nl/, check it out sometime. 


About the program:
This program is written in C++, and uses a lot of fstream, so the vocab can be stored in seperate CSV's. 
Any help regarding the words, cases and verbs is absolutely welcome! 
You are currently using the fourth version of the program, since I had to rewrite it trice (never again).
